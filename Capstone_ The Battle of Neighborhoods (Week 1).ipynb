PROJECT INTRODUCTION:\n\n\nMain goal of this project is to help the citizens to help and provide accurate and precise detail about the facilities around their neighborhood.Thousands of people and families are migrating to Canada and Greater Toronto Area is one of the most popular place in Ontario.So, Scarborough is one of the city which welcomes these immigrants in significant amount.It will help people making smart and efficient decision on selecting great neighborhood out of numbers of other neighborhoods in Scarborough, Toranto.\n\nWe are going to conduct comparative analysis between neighborhoods.The main factors we are going to focus are: housing price based on the facilities, schools, road and transportations, emergency services provided by the municipal corporation, crime rates of that particular area.This analysis will provide a better idea of the area and neighborhood before moving to this particular city."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "**BUSINESS PROBLEM**:\n\n\nThe challenge is to find a suitable apartment for rent in Scarborough, Toranto.That complies with the demands on location, price and venues.The data required to resolve this challenge is described in the following section.\n   "}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "# 2.

They actually crowd-sourced their data and had people use their app to build their dataset and add venues and complete any missing information they had in their dataset. Currently its location data is the most comprehensive out there, and quite accurate that it powers location data for many popular services like Apple Maps, Uber, Snapchat, Twitter and many others, and is currently being used by over 100,000 developers, and this number is only growing."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## Approach to solve this problem:"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": " In order to segement the neighborhoods and explore them, we will essentially need a dataset that contains\n    the 5 boroughs and the neighborhoods that exist in each borough as well as the the latitude and logitude coordinates of each neighborhood.\n\n**Tranform the data into a pandas dataframe:**\nThe next task is essentially transforming this data of nested Python dictionaries into a pandas dataframe.
